REFUELING:

Click on the REFUEL switch, ARM position to arm the refueling system and extend the refueling probe.  Click on the REFUEL switch again, OFF position to disarm the refueling system and retract the probe.  Fuel onload is at 6000 pounds per minute.

FUEL DUMP:

Click on the DUMP switch to toggle the fuel dump system.  The system will not dump lower than a standpipe level of 4000 pounds.

THE MODEL:

The model is made by Alpha Simulations (http://www.alphasim.co.uk/) and was done in Microsoft's native format (MDL) for use with MSFS.  It was released by them as "freeware, non-commercial", so don't sell this model.  I converted it to AC3D format for use in FlightGear.  I added a 3D cockpit, spoilers for roll control (the F-4 used a combination of ailerons and spoilers), animated slats, AIM-9 missles, refueling probe, lights, tanks. The texture was redone for the Luftwaffe version by V8Valle (aka D-ENTE).

THE AI MODEL: 

Since the model is so texture heavy I've included a very low-poly (and untextured) model in the /Models/AI directory.
